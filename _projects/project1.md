title: "Simple and Effective Masked Langauge Diffusion Models"
excerpt: "While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they have traditionally lagged behind autoregressive (AR) methods in language modeling. We apply an effective training recipe and derive a simplified, Rao-Blackwellized objective that improves the performance of language diffusion models."
