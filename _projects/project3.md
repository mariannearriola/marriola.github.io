title: "Disentangling Multi-Scale Anomaly Signals in Networks via Scale-Aware Contrastive Learning"
excerpt: "Detecting suspicious or unexpected patterns in networks without supervision is challenging because it requires heuristic knowledge about anomaly characteristics which is often unavailable in real-world settings. We perform extensive analysis on newly introduced real-world data with labelled ground-truth anomalies and identify cohesive anomalous communities that operate multiple scales based on their spatial and spectral profiles. We address multi-scale anomalous subgraph detection by introducing Multi-Scale Graph Anomaly Detection (MuSGAD), a self-supervised framework that learns multi-scale node embeddings via a multi-scale spectral filters and a contrastive learning objective, then flags anomalies with high residuals."
