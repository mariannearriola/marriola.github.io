I am a Computer Science PhD student at <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/">Cornell Tech</a> interested in generative AI, geometric deep learning, and ML for biomedicine. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kuleshov/">Volodymyr Kuleshov</a>. I am supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Bowers CIS Dean's Excellence/Hopper-Dean Fellowship.

Prior to coming to Cornell, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science in UC Santa Barbara's <a href="https://ccs.ucsb.edu/majors/computing">College of Creative Studies</a>. I formulated approaches for detecting multi-scale anomalies in graphs that exhibit unique spectral behavior in <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~ambuj/">Ambuj Singh's</a> group. In addition, I developed a model for protein structure optimization in <a href="https://cce.caltech.edu/people/frances-h-arnold">Frances Arnold's</a> group at Caltech and advanced primitive-aware representations for 3D point cloud learning in <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/">Justin Solomon's</a> group at MIT CSAIL.

Outside of research, I am passionate about supporting the success of underrepresented groups in higher education. I am actively involved in the review committee for the <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/">MIT Summer Resarch program</a> and as a volunteer for the Cornell Student-Applicant Support Program.
