I am a Computer Science PhD student at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) interested in geometric deep learning and machine learning for biomedicine. My current research direction is exploring geometry-aware out-of-domain generalization for multimodal single-cell data. I am supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Bowers CIS Dean's Excellence/Hopper-Dean Fellowship.

Prior to coming to Cornell, I completed my Bachelor of Science at UC Santa Barbara where I formulated approaches for detecting multi-scale anomalies in graphs that exhibit unique spectral behavior. In addition, I developed a model for protein structure optimization in Professor Frances Arnold's group at Caltech and advanced primitive-aware representations for 3D point cloud learning in Professor Justin Solomon's group at MIT CSAIL.
