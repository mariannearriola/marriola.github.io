I am a Computer Science PhD student at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) interested in geometric deep learning and machine learning for biomedicine. My current research direction is exploring out-of-domain generalization for graph-structured biological data. I am supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Bowers CIS Dean's Excellence/Hopper-Dean Fellowship.
