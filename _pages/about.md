I am a Computer Science PhD student at <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/">Cornell Tech</a> interested in generative AI, geometric deep learning, and ML for biomedicine. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kuleshov/">Volodymyr Kuleshov</a>. I am supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Bowers CIS Dean's Excellence/Hopper-Dean Fellowship.

Prior to coming to Cornell, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science in <a href="https://ccs.ucsb.edu/majors/computing">UC Santa Barbara's College of Creative Studies</a>.

Outside of research, I am passionate about supporting the success of underrepresented groups in higher education. I am actively involved in the review committee for the <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/">MIT Summer Resarch program</a> and as a volunteer for the Cornell Student-Applicant Support Program.
